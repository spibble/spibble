## Hi!

I go by a few different names online, but you can refer to me as **dragn**, **spibble**, or Miles if we know each other IRL.

## What do I make?

I make a lot of stuff! In the future there will be a good mix of things like web apps, scripts, embedded stuff, etc.; for now most of my coding stuff is for school/work/other private things or local (because I am lazy), but upon request I am happy to show!

## Where else can I be found?
- Check out my website at https://spibble.site!
- If you're someone on the internet, your best bets are contacting me at cybedra@gmail.com or on Discord (@.spibble).
- If you're someone IRL, like a hiring manager or recruiter, you likely already have my personal contact information (though if not, feel free to use the email address above and I'll make sure to get back to you!).
