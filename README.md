## Hi!

I go by a few different names online, but you can refer to me as dragn, spibble, or my real name, if you are someone I know IRL. Here, you can find some of my poorly-coded stuff.

## What do I make?

At some point when I start actually adding stuff to Github, there will probably be a good mix of different things here. But for now, I've mostly only used Github for school/work stuff, so that stuff's private. If you want to view a more concise and/or curated list of the things I've made, you can visit my website which I **will** make eventually at some point in the near future. I am **definitely** not procrastinating doing that.

## Where else can I be found?

If you want to contact me, Discord is your best bet (@cybedra). Otherwise... I don't really have a presence on most other platforms. Oh well :P I'm not itching to get on most of those anytime soon.
