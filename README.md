## Hi!

I go by a few different names online, but you can refer to me as dragn, spibble, or my real name, if you are someone I know IRL. Here, you can find some of my (lovingly) poorly-coded stuff.

## What do I make?

At some point when I start actually adding stuff to Github, there will probably be a good mix of different things here. But for now, I've mostly only used Github for school/work stuff, and that stuff is unfortunately private. In the near future, I will be making a personal website which will have a more concise and/or curated list of the things I've made.

## Where else can I be found?

- If you're someone on the internet, your best bets are contacting me at cybedra@gmail.com or on Discord (@cybedra).
- If you're someone IRL, like a hiring manager or recruiter, you likely already have my personal contact information (though if not, feel free to use the email address above and I'll make sure to get back to you!).
