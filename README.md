## Hi!

I go by a few different names online, but you can refer to me as **dragn**, **spibble**, or my real name (if you know me IRL).

## What do I make?

At some point I'll actually add stuff on here, and it'll be a good mix of stuff - but for now, I mainly use Github to track stuff for school/work, and that stuff is private (though I am happy to show it upon request).

## Where else can I be found?

- If you're someone on the internet, your best bets are contacting me at cybedra@gmail.com or on Discord (@cybedra).
- If you're someone IRL, like a hiring manager or recruiter, you likely already have my personal contact information (though if not, feel free to use the email address above and I'll make sure to get back to you!).
